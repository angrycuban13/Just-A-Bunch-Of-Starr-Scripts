# Scripts

These scripts interact directly with Radarr/Sonarr API for the most part. Someone wanted to do *X* and the tool didn't exist at the time, however, *X* can be accomplished via the API, so I wrote a script for it. Feel free to read through their respective READMEs to see if any of them would work for you.
